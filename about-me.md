Hello! I'm Tierra Williams. I'm a senior CS major with concentrations in cybersecurity and secure software design, data analytics and machine learning, and web and mobile application development.

I've primarily used JavaScript but I've also used Python, and Java for several projects.

I mostly code in my job at The Digital Corps on campus but I also code for a lot of my classes. I've had a few internships but they've been in cybersecurity with very minimal coding. I've also been involved in several research projects around campus where I did some React or python depending on the project. I have a hint (not much) of experience in php and C++.

The largest program or system that I've worked on is something that I just started working on. I'm helping Brandon Dean train his LLM to become a Dungeon Master. So I'm working on implementing the front end for that project. Another huge project that was done in several iterations was my CS222 final project. I worked in a group of four to make an app that queried the PetFinder API to display adoptable pets based on the entered location.

I feel more comfortable doing front end work than I do in back end development. Styling and putting the whole vision together comes more naturally than linking pages together. I'm very comfortable doing research (though it can take me a while to get started). And I tend to procrastinate if I'm not held accountable by my group.
